# Deep SQL Researcher

While browsing LinkedIn, I came across a post from a YC funded company discussing their work on a deep researcher for BI analytics. Intrigued by the concept, I decided to explore it further. Having previously built both a calendar SQL agent and a deep researcher, I realized I could combine these two ideas into a single project.

To test this agent-driven workflow, I needed a suitable dataset. After some searching, I discovered a dataset on [GitHub](https://github.com/lerocha/netflixdb), which contains a dump of Netflix data from their Engagement Report. This dataset serves as an excellent foundation for experimentation and development.
